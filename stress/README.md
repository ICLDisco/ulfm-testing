What is this?
=============

This is a set of stress tests that we use to validate that the ULFM implementation in Open MPI is correct.

These tests are designed to exercise capabilities that have a high potential of seeing correctness regressions
when other contributors make changes to the baseline Open MPI.

If you experience a bug with ULFM and can come up with a small reproducer, we are always eager to add more
tests so that fixed bugs do not return.
