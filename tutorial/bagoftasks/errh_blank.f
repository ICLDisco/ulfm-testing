C     Simulate the BLANK mode in FTMPI. Only peers communicating
C     directly with a dead process will notice the failures, and no
C     corrective actions will be taken globally (in other terms
C     communicator revocation is not an option). While this approach can
C     minimize the overhead, it makes difficult to recover the failure
C     of the master.

      subroutine error_handler(communicator, error_code)

C     Only the master will react to the failure. Every other process
C     will ignore all MPI_ERR_PROC_FAILED except if the dead process is
C     the master.
